## about me

(mainly) hobbyist programmer on the internet, fighting game / rhythm game / shooters enthusiast, but i play just about everything when it comes to video games.

my usual projects are written in Rust, but i can work with various languages, including but not limited to TypeScript, Python, C# and C/C++.

i am always open for job offers - hit me up at my email on the side, or `rylie` at `rylie` dot `moe`.

if you're reading this, i think you're cool.

## projects

i am cooking something in secret, so right now i don't have too much to showcase. but nonetheless, these are some of the projects i enjoy spending time working on.

### [closure-api](https://github.com/j1nxie/closure-api)

an API to fetch currently running events for the mobile tower defense gacha game, [Arknights](https://arknights.global). utilizes HTML scraping to parse data off of [gamepress.gg](https://gamepress.gg), built using TypeScript.

### [animedoro](https://github.com/j1nxie/animedoro)

a pomodoro clock, built on top of [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib). its defaults adhere to the animedoro method - 45 minutes work cycles, 25 minutes break for an anime episode. it is written in pure C, with a Zig build script as its build system.

## collaborative projects

### [Tachi](https://github.com/zkldi/Tachi)

a modular rhythm game score tracker, with support for various titles and networks. i implemented support for maimai DX, wrote the [import script](https://github.com/j1nxie/kt-maimaidx-site-importer) for official network players, on top of contributing database seeds for the game (along with [beerpsi](https://github.com/beer-psi)). i also worked on Arcaea support and contributed the initial database seeds for it, which now lives on [beerpsi's fork](https://github.com/beer-psi/Tachi).
