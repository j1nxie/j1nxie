mainly self-taught programmer, though i am pursuing a degree in university. i love
trying out new technologies and creating interesting projects. i enjoy creating
things, including outside of programming, and talking about what i created.

my main languages are Rust and TypeScript, but i can also use C++, Python and a few
others.

i am interested in job opportunities, and you can shoot me something to the email on
the information section of my github profile.

i enjoy japanese culture, including, but not limited to: anime, manga, vtubers
and video games. i play [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) and various games in my free
time.

i also randomly write blog posts at the website linked above, be it about programming,
interesting things i'm doing, or just rambling about anime.
