i'm an university student, majoring in Internet Communications and Technology.
in my free time, i code to create small projects and cool things. i like
fullstack, systems and emulation, but i'm down to learning just about anything.

i enjoy japanese culture, including, but not limited to: anime, manga, vtubers
and rhythm games. i play [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) and various games in my free
time.
